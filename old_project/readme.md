# Bachelor's Thesis by George Panov

*Cardiovascular diseases* are the leading cause of death worldwide. In 2016, the number of deaths was approximately 56,195,600 people, 17.9 million of whom died as a result of cardiovascular diseases. This is approximately 32% of all deaths. People with cardiovascular diseases or with high cardiovascular risk need early detection and treatment.

The goal of my bachelor thesis is to create a machine learning model that can predict cardiovascular diseases based on incoming data, thereby helping to save many lives.
